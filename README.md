# Programing-Quiz-Game
The Programming Quiz game offers players a series of questions related to programming, each accompanied by four answer options. Players must carefully consider each question and select the most appropriate answer from the given options. After answering all the questions, the game evaluates the player's responses to determine the correctness of each answer. Upon completion of the quiz, the game displays the player's cumulative score based on the number of correct answers chosen from the options. Additionally, to foster competition and motivation, the player's final score is stored and showcased on a leaderboard, allowing them to compare their performance with other players who have taken the quiz.
